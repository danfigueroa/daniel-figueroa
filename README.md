# My Personal Interactive Terminal Site

This is my personal website, designed to simulate an interactive terminal similar to those found in macOS and Linux. The interface is carefully crafted with inspiration from the **Shades of Purple** theme and the **Powerlevel10k** aesthetic, utilizing striking colors such as characteristic yellow along with complementary tones for an elegant and modern design.

## Technologies Used

-   **React**: Library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing for enhanced robustness and code quality.
-   **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server with support for HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
-   **CSS**: Used for styling the terminal, with variables that define a color palette inspired by Shades of Purple.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd <PROJECT_NAME>
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5. **Access the project**: Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (the address may vary based on configuration).

## Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the project for production.
-   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint for code analysis.
-   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build for preview.

## Project Purpose

This project was created to serve as my interactive online resume, showcasing my skills and experiences in an innovative way using a terminal interface.
